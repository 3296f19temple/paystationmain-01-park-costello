## Purpose
For this project, we are using a standardized code project from the previous paystation
project and implementing a main class so that a user can interact with the project.
To start this project, we imported the given code into a private repository
and protected the master branch so that peer reviews are required to merge
to master.

While creating the main method, there are a number of features that we need to
implement. First, we need a way of accepting nickels, dimes, and quarters for payment. 
Next, we need a way to convert these payments into time which is then displayed.
When using the buy function, these times should also be printed onto receipts. 
Whent the cancel function is used, the coin values and quantities are printed.
Lastly, we need to implement three different rate strategies for converting 
input coin value into time, and a means of swapping between the three.
